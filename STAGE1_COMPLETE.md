### Firestore Security Rules (Recommended):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Students can read timetables for their dept/semester/section
    match /timetables/{timetableId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Students can read unscheduled classes & exams
    match /unscheduled_classes/{classId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    match /exams/{examId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

## 📱 **Running the App**

### Web (Recommended for Firebase):
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Android:
```bash
flutter run -d <device_id>
```

### Note: Windows build has Firebase SDK compatibility issues. Use Web or Android/iOS for testing.
